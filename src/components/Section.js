            "Forever ba tayong employee?'" she wondered to herself. "Sabi ko, 'Why not we run a milk tea shop?'" That's when Cray pointed out that it might be more 
            practical to set up a coffee business as people drink the beverage more frequently than milk tea. Soon, they launched Coffee Code. Cray handled the design 
            aspect while Ram focused on the products.</p>
